# React State and Props Assignment

## Overview

The aim of this assignment is to strengthen your understanding of state and props management in React class components. You'll also practice conditional rendering and displaying lists, crucial aspects of dynamic React applications.

## Requirements

1. **Create a React Application**: Set up a new React application using Create React App or any other method you prefer.
2. **Components**: Create at least three components:
    - A parent component that holds the state.
    - Two child components that receive props from the parent component.
3. **State Management**: Use the state in the parent component to manage data.
4. **Passing Props**: Pass data from the parent component to the child components using props.
5. **Event Handling**: Implement event handling to update the state in the parent component and reflect the changes in the child components.

## Instructions

1. **Set Up the Project**:
    - Initialize a new React project.
    - Create the necessary components.

2. **Parent Component**:
    - Create a parent component that holds the state.
    - Initialize the state with some default values.
    - Implement methods to update the state.

3. **Child Components**:
    - Create two child components.
    - Receive props from the parent component.
    - Display the data received through props.

4. **Event Handling**:
    - Implement event handlers in the parent component.
    - Pass the event handlers as props to the child components.
    - Use the event handlers in the child components to update the state in the parent component.
